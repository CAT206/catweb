      <h2>Emission Reduction Projects</h2>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">We specialize in developing emission reduction projects that have prominent social impact and environmental benefits and we have established a solid track record of success..</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Our current focus is community-based projects with multiple co-benefits. Our flagship project is solar cooker projects that involved installing solar cookers for low-income rural families in remote areas to replace coal for cooking and water heating, which considerably improved the indoor air quality and reduced the expenses on purchasing coal.</p>
      <br></br>
