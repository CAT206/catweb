            Green financing is an important tool to build green economy. Green financing comprises the financing of public and private green investments in the areas such as environmental goods and services, as well as prevention, minimization and compensation of damages to the environment and to the climate. The goal of green financing is to increase level of financial flows (from banking, micro-credit, insurance and investment) from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors to sustainable development priorities. A key part of this is to better manage environmental and social risks, take up opportunities that bring both a decent rate of return and environmental benefit and deliver greater accountability.

        <p>
            Green financing could be promoted through changes in countries' regulatory frameworks, harmonizing public financial incentives, increases in green financing from different sectors, alignment of public sector financing decision-making with the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, increases in investment in clean and green technologies, financing for sustainable natural resource-based green economies and climate smart blue economy, increase use of green bonds, and so on.
