      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>Clean Air Trade, Inc. develops, manages, finances, and markets high-quality carbon offset projects as well as advises businesses and investors on how to mitigate climate-related risks and benefit from environmental finance.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>The company was established in 2006 to capture the new opportunities in the carbon market created by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under Kyoto Protocol. Since then, the company has been actively involved in the global carbon market, especially in emission reduction project development.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>We focus on developing projects with high social and environmental benefits. During the past 16 years, we have developed projects under Verra, and Gold Standard, and CDM. These projects generated millions of high-quality carbon credits, which have been used by many prestigious organizations for their net zero and ESG needs. Today we have become one of the premier developers/suppliers of high-quality carbon credits</p>

      <h2>Our Projects</h2>
      <p>We specialize in developing emission reduction projects that have prominent social impact and environmental benefits and we have established a solid track record of success.</p>

       <p>Our current focus is community-based projects with multiple co-benefits. Our flagship project is solar cooker projects that involved installing solar cookers for low-income rural families in remote areas to replace coal for cooking and water heating, which considerably improved the indoor air quality and reduced the expenses on purchasing coal. So far our projects have benefited hundreds of thousands low-income rural people and generated several million high-quality carbon credits.</p>
       <br></br>
        <p>For more information of our solar cooker project, please visit the project website www.SolarCookerCarbon.com </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>The advantages of our solar cooker projects are:</p>
        <ul class="item-list">
          <li>High-quality credits with many co-benefits</li>
          
          <li>Unquestionable additionality (carbon revenue is the only revenue)</li>
          
          <li>No ownership risk - the probability of being subject to nationalization or national policy restriction is virtually zero as opposed to the forestry projects.</li>
          
          <li>Flexible investment scale - can be done in stages based on the availability of funding</li>
          
          <li>Quick generation of carbon credits - No construction needed. Credits generated immediately after the cookstoves are distributed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The strengths of our team are:</p>
        <ul class="item-list">
          <li>Extensive experience with proven records of success</li>
          <li>Strong local network and good relationship with local communities.</li>
          <li>Local presence committed to long-term management and maintenance of the project.</li>
